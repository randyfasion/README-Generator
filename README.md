## Description
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled. A consumer will reach their fitness goals more quickly when they track their workout progress.
## Installation 
Run the following command at the root of your project: npm i OR npm install
